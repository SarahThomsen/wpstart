* Slides are created from images attached to the post/page it is displayed on (Wordpress Gallery)
* Responsive slider performs the same on every platform (desktop or mobile)
* Fade or slide effects
* Navigation with buttons, "dots", keyboard, scroll-wheel, automatic timer
* Show titles and descriptions with an overlay
* Link individual slides to any URL

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Help, it's not loading any images?! =

Try toggling the options on the Easy Gallery Slider settings page under "Help". If TimThumb is at fault, see the next question.


= Why isn't TimThumb working? =

* The must host support PHP and the GD image library plugin (check for GD support by creating a phpinfo page)
* Check the permissions on "timthumb.php" inside the easy-gallery-slider plugin folder, it should be 755. 
* Check the permissions on every directory above and including the easy-gallery-slider plugin directory. They should be set to something like 755, not 777.
* Try two different settings on the "cache" directory inside the easy-gallery-slider plugin directory: 775 and 777
* Check the error log for your host, there may be helpful information in there relating to "timthumb.php"
* Ask your host for help and to check your configuration. Also do they block the TimThumb script?


= What third party scripts are included? =

This slider uses the [Flexslider](http://www.woothemes.com/flexslider/) jQuery plugin. As well as [Timthumb](http://www.binarymoon.co.uk/projects/timthumb/).
